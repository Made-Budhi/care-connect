                                    The Rotary Club of Boulder and Swan Rotary Clubs work together with the Rotary Club of Bali-Denpasar to foster 
                                    genuine international goodwill in a very personal way. This is achieved by helping village children access primary 
                                    school education. Benefits include: school needs, classroom equipment, environmental education, health checks 
                                    and teacher development.

                                    The Bali-Sembung project began in 1999 supporting just three children. Since then, nearly two thousand children 
                                    have been assisted to attend primary school and are enjoying a brighter future. With assistance from a local 
                                    Rotarian or Rotaractor supporters are encouraged to meet the children at their school and this is certain to be a
