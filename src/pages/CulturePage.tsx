                                    Although we provide the children's birthdates, other than determining when the children start school, birthdays 
                                    are not particularly important to the children themselves. Balinese children do not celebrate their birthday every 
                                    twelve months as most westerners do.

                                    Of more cultural importance is the relationship between date of birth and important religious celebrations. For 
                                    example, when following the 210 day religious calendar, a birthday several days after Galungan will always be 
                                    celebrated several days after Galungan (irrespective of the date) and there may be two celebrations in a single 
                                    calendar year.

                                In Balinese Hindu culture, naming conventions follow traditional patterns that reflect the caste system 
                                and birth order. The naming system is deeply rooted in religious and cultural significance.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-4">
                                Common first names include Wayan, Made, Nyoman, and Ketut, which indicate the birth order of children 
                                in the family. These names are used regardless of gender and cycle through for subsequent children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Understanding these naming conventions helps us better connect with and respect the cultural identity 
                                of the children we support in our program.

                                Each parcel typically includes rice, cooking oil, sugar, salt, and other basic necessities that help 
                                ensure children have proper nutrition to support their education and development.
